# Django Blog Based Web Application!

1.) The following project uses Django 1.10 as the backend framework.

2.) On the front end, I have utilised HTML5, CSS3, JS and no framework as such!

3.) I have also embedded a working steps file in which I have documented everything I have done step by step to build this project.
